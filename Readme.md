# A.I-ChatBot-Using-OpenAi-api-and-Django

I created this project is to explore and gain familiarity with the OpenAI API, while also serving as a personal milestone in the journey towards mastering artificial intelligence. The integration of OpenAI's advanced language models allows developers to leverage its capabilities in generating high-quality code segments based on input prompts and contextual information.

>**_While my project was not intended for public deployment or hosting, I believe that it represents a 
valuable learning opportunity for anyone interested in exploring the possibilities of OpenAI Api_**
